# CodeToGPT

Welcome to **CodeToGPT**, a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of preparing codebases for interactions with AI models like ChatGPT. By concatenating multiple code files into well-organized documents, this application enhances the ease and efficiency of providing complex code contexts to AI, facilitating more accurate and context-aware responses.

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Handles both Python (`*.py`) and Java (`*.java`), creating separate output files for each language to ensure clarity and organization.
- **Automated Concatenation**: Automatically combines all code files from a specified directory into concise, single documentsâ€”ideal for large projects.
- **Ease of Use**: Offers a simple command-line interface that allows for straightforward operations without the need for complex GUIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start using **CodeToGPT**, make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.

### Installation

To install **CodeToGPT**, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install code-to-gpt
```


## Usage

To run **CodeToGPT**, navigate to your project directory and execute:

```bash
codetogpt '/path/to/source/folder'
```

## Usage

This command will generate:
- `combined_python_code.txt` for Python files.
- `combined_java_code.txt` for Java files.

These files will be created in the specified source folder, containing all the code from files of the respective languages found within that directory and its subdirectories.
